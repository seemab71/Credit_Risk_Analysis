# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The intent of this project was to compare different machine learning models in terms of accuracy in predicting of risk on a laon going into default.

### Results

Worst Accuracy Scores: Oversampling, Undersampling, Combination

Better Accuracy: Random Forest Classifier

Best Accuracy: Easy Ensemble AdaBoost



#### Summary 
The best model to use and recommended is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost. It has high accuracy and high sensitivity. The other models did not do as well and would increase
risk for potential bad loans.
